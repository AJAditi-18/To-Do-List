# To-Do-List
A To-Do list app created with the help of a Youtube video, some AI help for learning how to enhance it, and of course, my own skills!

Features of this app include:
1. Allows you to save the list
2. Marking tasks as done
3. Clearing all tasks
4. Switching to dark mode*

*For now, the switch from light mode to dark can be done only by changing the CSS file directly in HTML, because I feel like I need a little more time and a proper tutorial on how to do it correctly and in the best way, but I will surely add the option to switch to dark mode directly from the app sometime in the future!
